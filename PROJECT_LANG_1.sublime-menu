"id" : "I decided to make SublimeText the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-SublimeText) as SublimeText is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the SublimeText programming language. It only makes sense to SublimeText the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.",
